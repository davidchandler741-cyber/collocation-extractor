# Collocation Extractor

Tools for extracting and exploring collocations from text corpora, with a focus on linguistically meaningful patterns.

## Planned Features

- Tokenization and preprocessing
- N-gram extraction (bigrams, trigrams, etc.)
- Collocation measures (MI, t-score, log-likelihood – TBD)
- Frequency tables and sorted output
- Basic visualization (e.g., bar charts of top collocations)

## Tech Stack

- Python
- nltk / spaCy (TBD)
- pandas
- matplotlib (for basic plots)

## Status

Planning phase – code coming soon.
